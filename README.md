#Virtual Vending Machine Application

This was the first capstone project in the Tech Eelvator Java program.

I worked with another student to develop a virtual vending machine based on the README.md in the mod1-capstone-blue-t5/java folder.

To test out the application, open the pom.xml (found in the mod1-capstone-blue-t5/java folder) in IntelliJ or your preferred Java IDE and run the VendingMachineCLI main method.
